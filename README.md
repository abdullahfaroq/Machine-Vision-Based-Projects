# Machine-Vision-Based-Projects
This MATLAB project utilizes machine vision for analyzing road traffic videos. The system processes video files to detect and track moving vehicles, providing output video frames with bounding boxes around each detected vehicle.

## Key Features
- Automatic Video Loading: Streamlines video processing workflow.
- Noise Removal: Utilizes Gaussian filtering for cleaner frames.
- Grayscale Conversion: Simplifies image analysis.
- Car Segmentation: Identifies and isolates vehicles in frames.
- Statistical Analysis: Extracts traffic metrics (number of vehicles, mean size, total area).
- Bounding Boxes: Visualizes detected vehicles.

## Applications
- Traffic Management: Enhances monitoring and control.
- Surveillance: Automates vehicle detection and tracking.
- Urban Planning: Offers data-driven insights for infrastructure.
- Security and Emergency Response: Supports traffic analysis during critical situations.

## Counterfeit Coin Detection
This project, included in the same directory, focuses on detecting counterfeit coins from images. It utilizes image processing techniques in MATLAB to analyze coin images and distinguish genuine coins from counterfeits.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed on your computer.

### Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdullahfaroq/Machine-Vision-Based-Projects.git
